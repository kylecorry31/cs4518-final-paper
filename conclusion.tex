\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we presented the \input{appName.tex} Android application which would help to prevent students from being late to meetings by notifying them of when to leave and what time they will arrive. We discussed methods of how we calculated how long it will take the user to make it to the meeting and how we notify them of when to leave and when they will be late. To our knowledge, this is the first system of its kind which knows how the user is going to the meeting and learns how fast they normally travel to give them insights into what time they need to leave to be there on time. Of course, we only had around 2-3 limited weeks to work on the app in the so there is always room for improvement.
