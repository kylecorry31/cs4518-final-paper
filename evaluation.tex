\section{Evaluation/Results}
Our app was successful in alerting its users to their meetings. One of our team members would have shown up late to our presentation had they not been using Remind Me (done for testing purposes of course). The app's unique ETA estimating algorithm has built-in padding, so it always overestimates the time required for the user to get to the destination. 

Members of the team used the app for navigating to various meetings, including a trip from Founders to Lee Street. None of us have bicycles so we were unable to test the biking feature, but that part of the app mostly uses Google's Activity Recognition and Google Maps anyway. Our app estimates travel time for bicycles as being roughly half that of walking.

Walking directions were thoroughly evaluated. The app always left enough time for the user to arrive early.
