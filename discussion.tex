We found that letting users know about their meetings made them more effective at arriving to their engagements on time. We also discovered that Google's Activity API is really slow at identifying the user's actions. When predicting the time required to travel to an appointment, we had several options. We could look at what the user was currently doing. We could look at what the user's phone said they were doing. Or we could have asked the user how they planned on getting to the event when they scheduled said event. To simplify the user experience, we chose to look only at the first two options. For predicting the travel time, we chose to look at how far away the event was. This method provided a pretty accurate estimate. When the user pressed the button to open the Google Maps navigation, however, we looked at the user's current activity to determine whether we should select walking directions or driving directions. If the Google Activity API had been faster to identify the current activity, this method would have worked quite well. Unfortunately, most people start navigation before leaving for their event. The directions ended up being walking directions for most trips unless the user had been driving for a long time before starting navigating.
