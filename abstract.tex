Many students find themselves distracted by studying, homework, games, etc. and then realize that they should have already left to attend a meeting - they will now be late, again. Another reason for being late is that users underestimate the time it will take them to walk to a location because it looks close on a map to them ~\cite{raghubir1996crow}. Being late for meetings is embarrassing, especially if it happens often, and is counterproductive for both the student who is late and those waiting for them. Time is very important at college, so being on time to a meeting could save a few minutes in the end as the meeting can start on time. \input{appName.tex} is designed to notify the user of when they have to leave to arrive on time based on the speed that the app learns they normally walk at. It also recomputes the ETA on the fly as the person is making their way to the meeting so they know they will be on time or not based on their current mode of transit and speed.
