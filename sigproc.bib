	abstract={The purpose of this paper is to describe an automated geographic information system (GIS) process to estimate the length of pipeline required to provide utility service to a potential customer base using the street rights-of way. Using a case study application for a large gas utility company, we compare this method to the traditional method based on straight-line Euclidean, or as-the-crow-flies, distances. The GIS method using the street rights-of-way provides a substantially more accurate estimate of the length of required pipeline than the as-the-crow-flies method does. The improvement is particularly significant when the potential customers are located a substantial distance from existing pipelines. With improved estimates of required pipeline length, utilities can pre-qualify potential customers for marketing opportunities.},
