\section{Introduction}
In project-based group settings, being late to meetings is a serious problem. If one member is late, it detracts from the whole group's progress. People who are chronically late are often viewed as the "bad" group mate. Nobody wants to be the bad group mate. In order to be late, one must simply leave for the meeting later than one should. The majority of the time, people are late when they misjudge when they should leave for a meeting. Other times they know when they need to leave, but don't look at the clock enough, and miss the time they need to leave. Our app was designed so it not only lets the user know what time they need to leave to get to a meeting on time but also actively nags them if they're not on track to arrive when they need to. We also added further incentives for the user to avoid running late by having the app notify others in the meeting by SMS whenever the user is running late and is not actively trying to make up time to arrive on schedule.
