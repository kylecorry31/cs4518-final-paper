\section{Future Work}
Future versions of this app could incorporate many additional features to improve the eta estimates for the user. Future versions could add calendar integration so that the app can pull meeting times and locations from the user's outlook calendar. With this integration, an additional useful feature would be automatically converting a location to usable GPS coordinates for the app to use. A final major future item to do to the app would be to add more advanced machine learning algorithms to automatically adjust estimated travel times for particular users. If a user walks really fast or slow, the app would recognize this and adjust the estimated travel times accordingly to give better alerts on when to leave.

Other improvements may be GPS smoothing to avoid jumping around with bad GPS signals. Finally, users may find it useful to be able to set their own default speed (although the system will learn it) and be able to identify which forms of transportation that they may use.
